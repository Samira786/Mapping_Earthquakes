# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Project Summary
In this project, we work with Disaster Reporting Networks to use data visualization using Leaflet to plot earthquakes in the last 7 days using GeoJSON from the U.S. Geological Survey website. Some of the features of the map include Bubble pop-ups that show magnitude and location of the earthquake and a legend reflecting the magnitude by color of the bubble. Additionally, there are options to change the map visually on the top right corner to the following: Satellites, Streets, Light, and display the tectonic and earthquake symbols.

### Tools
The coding languages and tools used for the project include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, D3, Leaflet, Mapbox, and GeoJSON.
